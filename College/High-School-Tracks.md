#High School Tracks

*Disclaimer: This page was taken from a talk on high school->college admissions.*

Generally, students follow a track in high school. Many, understandably, have not yet narrowed their interests to a singular track, or may have aspirations in a number of tracks. As a result, it is perfectly normal to follow up to three tracks. Typically, handling more paths is harmful both to students' mental states and to their performance in these tracks. Only in rare cases is it adviseable to pursue more than one path.

This is true both for college admissions, but more so as general life advice. Facing college admissions as a long game is the best way to view the process. You are not trying to shape yourself for a particular college - you are only trying to shape your resume to best represent what you have done. If you have pursued one track, it just makes it easier to know how to tailor your resume to fit your personality and interests.

Below are a few examples of popular tracks pursued by high school students. It is not exhaustive, and students are encouraged to pursue their own tracks if they have more specific interests than detailed. A few popular competitions are listed next to each track, to give an example of programs often pursued by students.
